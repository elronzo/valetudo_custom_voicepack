# valetudo_custom_voicepack
Create a custom voicepack for use with Valetudo
(1-minute-code provided by ChatGPT)

Change constants PORT, COUNTRY_CODE and TAR_FILENAME to your needs.

create_voicepack.py takes all the ogg files in the current directory and puts them into a tar.gz file. This file is served on the local machine afterwards. Just copy the URL, country code and the hash the script provides.

Use http://valetudo-yourrobot.local/#/options/robot/misc to upload the voicepack.
